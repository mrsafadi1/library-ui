This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before running the development server:
open terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
```
then
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
after doing this, you need to run the Springboot application(backend server) to be able to view the data(follow the README instructions). then, 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
